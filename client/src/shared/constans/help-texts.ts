  Add ingredients with their quantity and unit (e.g., 100 g of sugar). 
  You can add more items using the '+ Add ingredient' button.
  
  ⚠️ **Attention!** If you specify an ingredient in pieces (unit "piece"), 
  you’ll need to provide the weight in grams per piece.
  
  💡 **Also note:** The service uses a third-party API to fetch ingredient data. 
  For better accuracy, please use full and specific ingredient names — for example, instead of "salt", write "salt table ionized", and instead of "milk", use "whole milk".
